# On-Demand-Traffic-Light-Control

Traffic lights are signal devices used to control the traffic over a road intersections and 
pedestrian crossings.  
It consists of three lights, each light has information for driver to follow weather to stop and wait 
or free to go. 
The standard traffic light consists of Red, Yellow, Green lights. 
Red means the vehicle must stop, yellow means to get ready weather to move or to stop, and 
green means free to go.  
The proposed system is a simulation of a traffic light with pedestrian button to allow pedestrian 
push the button when they want to cross the road, so the vehicle Red light be on and pedestrian 
green light be on to be free to cross the road.
